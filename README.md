### Details
This is my second attempt at writing code to integrate idMyGadget
[jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8) with the default Drupal 8 theme Bartik.

I am abandoning this effort after very little work, due to serious issues with a theme named stark_idmygadget (see the [jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8-second_try](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8-second_try) repo), which do not occur when that theme was renamed to jmws_drupal_idmygadget_stark-d8 (see the [jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8) repo).

Weird I know, but we do what we have to do.
